# HeavyThing [ht-1.24]

Repo of [Jeff's HeavyThing ASM library](https://2ton.com.au/HeavyThing)  

I thought about changing the name but I changed my mind instead. Jeff has put such effort into this library and a great number of developers already know what **HeavyThing** is, I didn't want to mess with that.  
This will be the official source repository for **_HT_**. Jeff's work will always be referenced from here. We will undergo a few changes as he continues to develop new tools. I wholly recommend everyone go visit his site and learn what he has to share.

  As the OpenPlatform Initiative grows and frameworks are introduced, we will likely re-organize directories, etc. All thoughts about what we _might_ need to consider later on.
